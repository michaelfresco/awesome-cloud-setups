## Awesome Cloud Setups

With [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/), and [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), we can make some really interesting setups.
However, as good as they are, they are also hard to configure and figure out.
The setups listed here are intended for small projects or small businesses.
They are more practical, and show something that you could realistically implement.

Ideally, the guides here hit the following criteria:

1. ready for production
2. easy to follow
3. cost-effective

For example, [Cloud Run with GitHub Actions](cloud-run-gh-actions.md) is a setup that has all three characteristics.
(It might be one of the best ways right now to host a small website.)
However, [Kubernetes with Autopilot](gke-autopilot.md) could also surprise you.
(It can effectively scale down to zero).
